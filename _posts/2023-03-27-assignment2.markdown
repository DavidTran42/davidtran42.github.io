Covid19 has been a global phenomena that has impacted the world in many levels. What we are interested to look further into is looking through the crime data of San Fransisco from the year 2018 to 2022, to see what the numbers were prior and after Covid19. Covid19 reached the US in the early 2020, and the first covid case happened in the 30th of January for San Francisco.

Interesting information to look at based on the interactive bar chart is the fact that the numbers of prostitution and traffic violations arrests were dropped drastically at the year 2020 and the remaining crimes either had same cases or less drop in numbers of incidents. The ones that had an increased amount of crime were arson, motor vehicle theft, weapon offenses and burglary. All of these information makes sense due to the fact Covid19 caused restrictions within the Country, which also affected the state, so people were mostly indoors. Especially prostitution took a big hit due to Covid19 lead to less human contact outside your own family and having less money due to the hit onto the economy. Less money also meant people committed more crimes that could help them in their economic situation like theft and burglary. The reasoning for increased violence and arson were due to protests of the Covid19 restrictions that some people were not happy, which can be seen as an example from this [article][arti-cle]. The restrictions were necessary to minimize the spread of Covid19, which is why most people also stayed indoors. Despite most people staying indoors the increasing numbers of burglary is alarming, which is why this post will further investigate these numbers.

Looking at the hours of the day between before and after 2019. It is a clear indicator, that it has changed the time for when the burglary is happening, as prior it was uncommon to see it happened during the night and near morning, which is now among the most occurrent thing that happens after the year 2019. It might be due to the fact, that most people resided at home at normal hours, where they usually would be at work. So burglary had to now happen during the night, which the burglars would think would be the safest time slot to commit the crime.

Looking further into the different district at 4 am, it is easy to tell that the burglary happens mostly in the northern and central district of San Francisco, which are the places you would want to avoid having your home at those districts.

Overall from this investigation by looking in the crime data before and after Covid19, it is clear that Covid19 had an affect on the crime incidents. Most crime incidents got lowered but a few incidents got increased numbers of their crime. The one that is interesting to look at is the burglary numbers, where the burglary now happens more often during the night rather than the day, where most people were at work. If you want to live in San Francisco, you would most likely avoid to get a home near the northern and central district.
